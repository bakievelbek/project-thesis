\chapter{Conclusion}

This thesis explored the use of MetricGAN, a deep learning approach, for speech enhancement under various noise conditions. Experiments were conducted at different noise levels (0 dB, 5 dB, 10 dB, 15 dB, and 20 dB) and compared MetricGAN's performance with a traditional Wiener filter.

The results demonstrated that MetricGAN consistently outperformed the Wiener filter, especially in improving perceptual speech quality (PESQ scores). MetricGAN showed significant advantages in moderately noisy conditions, clearly enhancing both audio clarity and quality. However, in extremely noisy scenarios (0 dB), intelligibility improvements remained limited for all methods.

Overall, MetricGAN proved to be a robust and effective solution for enhancing speech signals, particularly where classical methods like the Wiener filter fall short. Future research could further optimize MetricGAN for extremely challenging conditions and investigate integrating visual information or other complementary techniques to enhance intelligibility even further.
